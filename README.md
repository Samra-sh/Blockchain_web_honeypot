Step 1: Set up a Honeypot on the Web Page
Create a honeypot in the form of a login page, admin panel, or a vulnerable API on your website that attackers are likely to target. This could be as simple as a form that looks like a database admin panel or something more advanced like an open SSH port.
Example: A fake login page with deliberately insecure parameters, vulnerable to SQL injection, or other attacks.

Step 2: Capture Honeypot Interactions
Write code that logs interaction details (IP addresses, input values, timestamps, etc.) when someone attempts to access the honeypot or interact with vulnerable parts of the website.
For logging the attackerâ€™s behavior, you could use JavaScript on the client-side (e.g., capturing unusual form input) or use backend languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js to record specific requests and interactions with the honeypot.
Step 3: Smart Contract to Log Attacks
Smart Contracts (for blockchains like Ethereum) can be used to log each interaction automatically when the honeypot is accessed.
A smart contract could be triggered whenever a user interacts with the vulnerable parts of the website. For example, if someone attempts a SQL injection or tries to brute force a login, the interaction is automatically written to the blockchain.

Step 4: Blockchain Transaction for Logging Data
When an attack is detected (e.g., SQL injection attempt), a transaction is made to call the logAttack() function of the smart contract, recording the attack details on the blockchain.

Step 5: Monitor and Analyze Logs
You can retrieve the logged data from the blockchain using web3.js or similar libraries to analyze attack attempts.
You can view all the logs using honeypotContract.methods.getLogs().call(), which will provide all recorded interactions in a tamper-proof manner.

Step 6: Secure the Blockchain Transactions
Make sure that only legitimate honeypot interaction data is written to the blockchain.
You could use signatures, authentication mechanisms, or filtering to ensure that only real attack interactions are logged.
